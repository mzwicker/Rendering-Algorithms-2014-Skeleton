# Rendering-Algorithms-2014-Skeleton

This project contains Java basecode developed for a "Rendering Algorithms" course at the University of Bern. This is educational code intended for students to learn about realistic 3D rendering. The code solely provides a skeleton architecture that can be the basis for a Monte Carlo renderer using ray tracing.
